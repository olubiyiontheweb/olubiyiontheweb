As you are already wondering what does he do? So here is a breakdown.

I'm a backend and computer vision engineer. I love building interactive projects which explains my current interest in computer vision. In doing that I employ different techniques and platforms to reach my goal, depending on the target platform, web, desktop or mobile.

I'm very enthusiastic about the future of computer vision, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality and Augmented Reality. I'm open to projects and opportunities in any of the afformentioned areas.
